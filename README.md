# XBR API library

**You can find the generated XBR API library docs [online](https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/xbr.foundation/api/index.html).**

This repository contains a library of XBR Interfaces ("APIs") shared in the XBR network and community for use with XBR Services in XBR based open data markets.

To generate the docs yourself and start modifying or extending the XBR API library, please see [here](api/README.md).
